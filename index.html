    <section id="About">
        <p>Wilhelm Roentgen,a professor, discovered X-rays in 1895.It was discovered accidentally—while testing whether cathode rays could pass through glass. His crookes tube was covered in heavy black paper, so he was surprised when an incandescent green light nevertheless escaped and projected onto a nearby fluorescent screen. Through experimentation, he found that the mysterious light would pass through most substances but leave shadows of solid objects. Because he did not know what the rays were, he called them ‘X,’ meaning ‘unknown,’ rays.</p>
